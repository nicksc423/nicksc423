### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick Collins (@nicksc423)
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at nicksc423@gmail.com for business inquires!

#### Please check out the following repos if you are looking for a quick example of my work:
- **[Azure-Infrastructure](https://github.com/nicksc423/azure-infrastructure)** which contains a terraform script I wrote to fully generate an Azure account with AKS, Postgres, and much more!
- **[Kong](https://github.com/nicksc423/kong)** which contains a helm chart to run Kong (broken apart into an ingress & control plane so they can scale seperately) and an associated postgres DB
- **[Web-Health-Check](https://github.com/nicksc423/web-health-check)** which is a simple Go app that makes a POST request to a webapi and exposes a prometheus metrics based on the response

I also have various other repositories based on whatever I've been working on at the time ðŸ˜Š
