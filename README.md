### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick Collins (@nicksc423)
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at nicksc423@gmail.com for business inquires!

#### Please check out the following repos if you are looking for a quick example of my work:
- **Azure-Infrastructure** which contains a terraform script I wrote to fully generate an Azure account with AKS, Postgres, and much more!
- **Kong** which contains a helm chart to run Kong (broken apart into an ingress & control plane so they can scale seperately) and an associated postgres DB
- **Web-Health-Check** which is a simple Go app that makes a POST request to a webapi and exposes prometheus metrics based on the results

I also have various other repositories based on whatever I've been working on at the time ðŸ˜Š
